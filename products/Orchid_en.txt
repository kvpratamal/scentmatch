Orchid is the signature of Legendary, inspired by the tropical rainforests of Malaysia. Exotic Orchid For Extraordinary Soul reflects the essence of Legendaryâ€™s perfumes, crafted for those with an exceptional spirit.

Orchid offers a light and fresh scent, beginning with vibrant top notes of orange, apple, and green lemon, which invigorate the senses. The heart features a floral array of pansy, magnolia, Cattleya orchid, and muguet, creating a serene garden atmosphere. It concludes with base notes of peach, amber, musk, and cedar, delivering a comforting finish. Ideally for those who love a fragrance that is both refreshing and richly layered.
